AoC solutions 
Here are some of my solutions for AdventOfCode 2015 tasks. 
Couter.cpp is for the 1st task. Starting with the 2nd one files named as AoCN.cpp, where N is a number of a task.
Every task on AoC consist of 2 parts. All the solutions are for the 2nd part of a task. Input files are named as InputN.txt, where N is a number of a task. Do not forget to change a pathway to the input file on your computer.
